# api-data-pull-system
A basic proof-of-concept for cheap data pipeline.

At a high level, there are 3 files in this project:
1. A .py file that interacts with the API to pull and manipulate data.
2. A .sh file that builds the AWS infrastructure from the command line.
3. A .sh file that tears down the AWS infrastructure from the command line.

Will add more documentation as necessary / if I feel like it.
